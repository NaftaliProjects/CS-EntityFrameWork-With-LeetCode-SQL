# LeetCode SQL Problems: C# & Entity Framework
This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode SQL problems, implemented using **C#** and **Entity Framework Core**. Each problem is set up with a dedicated class to handle database setup, problem-solving logic, and result printing.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you'll need to have a few things set up on your machine.

### Prerequisites

* **.NET SDK:** Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed. You can download it from the official [.NET website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
* **SQL Server:** This project uses SQL Server. Make sure you have an instance running and accessible. The connection string in the code points to `localhost\SQLEXPRESS01`, so you may need to modify it if your server instance is different.
* **Entity Framework Core Tools:** You'll need the EF Core tools to manage migrations. You can install them with the following command:

    ```bash
    dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
    ```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd LeetCodeProblems
    ```
2.  **Restore dependencies:**
    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```
3.  **Update Connection Strings:**
    Open the files for each problem (e.g., `LeetCodeProblems_1148.cs`, `LeetCodeProblems_1174.cs`) and update the `options.UseSqlServer()` connection string to match your local SQL Server configuration.
4.  **Run the project:**
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

## Project Structure

The project is organized with a clear structure to keep each problem's solution self-contained and easy to follow.

* `LeetCodeProblems/`: The root directory for the project.
    * `Main.cs`: The main entry point of the application. It calls the `Example()` method for each problem to demonstrate the solution.
    * `Migrations/`: This folder contains the database migration files generated by Entity Framework Core.
    * `Problem_XXXX.cs`: Each problem has its own file containing the `MainProg` class for the solution. This is where you'll find the C# code that queries the database.
    * `Problem_XXXX_Database.cs`: This file contains the Entity Framework `DbContext` and the `POCO` classes (Plain Old C# Objects) that represent the database tables.

## Solved Problems

This project currently includes solutions for the following LeetCode problems, with the problem number listed as a heading. Each solution file contains the problem description and example data as comments for easy reference.

### 1148. Article Views I
**Description:** Find all authors who have viewed at least one of their own articles. The solution uses Entity Framework Core to query the `Views` table where `author_id` is equal to `viewer_id`.

### 1174. Immediate Food Delivery II
**Description:** The solution for this problem is contained in `LeetCodeProblems_1174.cs`.

### 570. Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports
**Description:** The solution for this problem is contained in `LeetCodeProblems_570.cs`.

### 595. Big Countries
**Description:** The solution for this problem is contained in `LeetCodeProblems_595.cs`.

### 1757. Recyclable and Low Fat Products
**Description:** The solution for this problem is contained in `LeetCodeProblems_1757.cs`.

### 584. Find Customer Referee
**Description:** The solution for this problem is contained in `LeetCodeProblems_584.cs`.

##  How It Works

Each problem's solution follows a simple pattern:

1.  **Database Setup:** A new `DbContext` is created, and the database is configured to use your SQL Server instance. The `EnsureDeleted()` and `EnsureCreated()` methods are used to create a clean database for each problem run.
2.  **Seed Data:** Example data from the LeetCode problem description is added to the database using Entity Framework's `AddRange()` and `SaveChanges()`.
3.  **Problem Solving:** The solution logic is implemented using **LINQ (Language-Integrated Query)**, which translates directly into SQL queries executed by Entity Framework.
4.  **Result Display:** The results are printed to the console in a human-readable format, often mirroring the expected output from LeetCode.
